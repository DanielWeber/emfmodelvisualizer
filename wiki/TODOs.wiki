#summary This is a collection of TODOs.

This page summarizes the status of several topics. This page was kicked off by a discussion between Daniel and Christoph. Please feel free to add your comments and thoughts. 

== Prepare for a release ==

* The project needs eclipse feature projects and an update site project in order to release it (see Issues 18,19 and 25).

FIXME: Define features which we want to provide

* Is it planned to include this project in a future oaw release? 

* Are packages and project names ok? Is there a convention for oaw?

* Setup automated build - Maybe with tycho and maven 3?

== Compatibility with Helios ==

Helios and Xtext might bring some changes which are not compatible with Galileo . The current Trunk should be reactivated und used for the Helios Release. The Galileo branch should exist in parallel. A brief documentation of the branches is required.

== Documentation ==

* The documentation should be updated (see Issue 21).

CKulla: Will provide documentation on Xtext Grammar visualization, ecore Metamodel and eobject visualization. Will also provided block diagram documentation (only if is released, imho not ready yet).

* Decision about the documentation format required. Provide help in eclipse format. 
How is Xtext doing this?

== Zest ==

* Add transformation from Zest to Graphviz and vice versa.

* Add SVG export

* Enhance view to automatically reflect changes in the source model

* Check class loader issues

== Blockdiagram ==

* Integrate fixes from Daniel

* Add svg export

* Enhance workflow selection

* Enhance view to automatically reflect changes in the source model

== Tests ==

There are not tests atm :(. We should really have some.
