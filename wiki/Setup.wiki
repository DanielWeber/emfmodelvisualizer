#summary How to set up the projects if you want to participate

= Checkout =

if you want to commit changes register first and then checkout via svn using _https_, your google account username and the google provided password.

= Dependencies =
In order to build the Eclipse projects, you have to have TMF XText installed in your development environment.

In addition to that, you need

 * zest: http://www.eclipse.org/gef/zest/
 * GraphViz: http://TODO

depending on the particular visualization you're interested in.

= Setup the projects in Eclipse =
After checking out the projects you'll notice that they don't compile (because classes refer to generated code). You have to run a few MWE workflows to generate the missing artifacts. But before that, you'll have to fix build path errors by creating a new directory named src-gen in each of the following projects:

 * org.openarchitectureware.vis.graphmm35
 * org.openarchitectureware.graphviz
 * org.openarchitectureware.vis.blockdiagram.metamodel

Then run the following MWE-Workflows:

 * org.openarchitectureware.vis.graphmm35/src/org/openarchitectureware/vis/GenerateGraphmm35.mwe)
 * org.openarchitectureware.graphviz/src/org/openarchitectureware/vis/graphviz/GenerateDot.mwe)
 * org.openarchitectureware.vis.blockdiagram.metamodel/src/org/openarchitectureware/vis/blockdiagram/metamodel/GenerateBlockDiagram.mwe)

And all compilation errors should be gone.
