/**
 * An extension to the IEntityConnectinStyleProvider that allows styling
 * specific to bezier curves.
 * 
 * Bezier curves are defined by a set of four points: two point in the layout
 * (start and end), and two related control points (also start and end). The
 * control points are defined relative to their corresponding layout point. This
 * definition includes an angle between the layout point and the line between
 * the two layout points, as well as a ratio distance from the corresponding
 * layout point. The ratio distance is defined as a fraction between 0 and 1 of
 * the distance between the two layout points. Using this definition allows
 * bezier curves to have a consistant look regardless of the actual positions of
 * the nodes in the layouts.
