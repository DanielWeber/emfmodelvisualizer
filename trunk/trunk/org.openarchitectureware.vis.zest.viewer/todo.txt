* How can I set different arrow heads/tails?
* Seems to me the arrow heads only show up 
  after I select a connection... bug?
* what does the node style fisheye do?
* is there an algorithm that avoid edges
  "running over" other nodes?
  
* drill down... with breadcrumbs for the way back
* graphcontainer?
* curved connections?
* Position festhalten
* Compartments
* Hightlight alle Dependencies nach Klick auf Node, und die Knoten am anderen Ende.


Asked Ian:

* Why are graph containers bigger than normal nodes? This is rather ugly...
* Can I change the size of the area created "under" a graph container?
* Can I zoom somehow generally? And specifically, into a container?
