* How can I set different arrow heads/tails?
* Seems to me the arrow heads only show up 
  after I select a connection... bug?
* what does the node style fisheye do?
* is there an algorithm that avoid edges
  "running over" other nodes?
  
* drill down... with breadcrumbs for the way back
* graphcontainer?
* curved connections?
* hints to Zest? Straight? Curved? Layout?
