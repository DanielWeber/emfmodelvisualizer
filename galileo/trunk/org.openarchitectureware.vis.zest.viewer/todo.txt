* How can I set different arrow heads/tails?
* what does the node style fisheye do?
* is there an algorithm that avoid edges
  "running over" other nodes?
  
* drill down... with breadcrumbs for the way back
* graphcontainer?
* curved connections?
* Position festhalten
* Compartments
* Hightlight alle Dependencies nach Klick auf Node, und die Knoten am anderen Ende.
* Is there a "Lasso" selection?
* Interactively "grow"; how can I turn off the animation that's shown upon redraw?
* Larger canvas/viewport to use more space in the graph?

Asked Ian:

* Why are graph containers bigger than normal nodes? This is rather ugly...
* Can I change the size of the area created "under" a graph container?
* Can I zoom somehow generally? And specifically, into a container?

Solved: 

* How can I select a connection as opposed to a node?
   ==> [DanielWeber] Just click on it ;)
    
* Seems to me the arrow heads only show up 
  after I select a connection... bug?
   ==> [DanielWeber] works if style is set when creating the connection. Otherwise the figure is created without that 
                     flag but updated when the connection is selected the first time.
